# Sample Puzzle - Day 1

## Concept: The Missing Detail
**Difficulty**: Easy (Day 1 should be approachable)
**Theme**: Office theft
**Contradiction Type**: Timeline inconsistency

---

## Case Summary

A laptop was stolen from an office building overnight. Security footage and witness statements have been collected. One detail in the report doesn't add up.

---

## The Report

**Incident**: Laptop stolen from 3rd floor office

**Security Log**:
- Building locked at 6:00 PM
- Motion sensor triggered on 3rd floor at 11:45 PM
- Front door access card used at 11:52 PM (exit)

**Suspect Statement** (Jamie Chen, cleaning staff):
- "I finished cleaning the 3rd floor around 11:30 PM"
- "I took the stairs down and left through the front door"
- "I didn't see anyone else in the building"

**Physical Evidence**:
- Office window found closed and locked
- Laptop charging cable left behind on desk
- No signs of forced entry

**Building Details**:
- Elevator out of service for maintenance
- Stairwell lights on motion sensors (auto-off after 2 minutes)
- Security cameras offline due to software update

## Your Task

**Find the ONE detail that doesn't fit.**

Tap the statement that contains the inconsistency:

1. Motion sensor triggered on 3rd floor at 11:45 PM
2. "I finished cleaning the 3rd floor around 11:30 PM"
3. Front door access card used at 11:52 PM (exit)
4. Office window found closed and locked
5. Laptop charging cable left behind on desk
6. Elevator out of service for maintenance

## Solution

**Answer**: Statement #2 - "I finished cleaning the 3rd floor around 11:30 PM"

**Why it doesn't fit**:

If Jamie finished cleaning at 11:30 PM and the motion sensor triggered at 11:45 PM (15 minutes later), someone else must have been on the 3rd floor—or Jamie is lying about when they finished.

Since Jamie used their access card to exit at 11:52 PM (only 7 minutes after the motion sensor), and they claim to have left the 3rd floor at 11:30 PM, the timeline doesn't work. They would have needed 22 minutes to get from the 3rd floor to the front door using just stairs.

**The truth**: Jamie was still on the 3rd floor at 11:45 PM (triggering the motion sensor), meaning they lied about finishing at 11:30 PM.

💡 "Pay close attention to the times. Do they all line up?"

**After 2nd wrong answer**:
💡 "How long would it take to walk down stairs? Compare that to the security logs."

## Why This Works as Day 1

✅ **Simple contradiction**: Basic timeline math
✅ **Limited variables**: Only 6 statements to choose from
✅ **Single logical step**: If A happened at X time and B happened at Y time, C doesn't fit
✅ **No specialized knowledge**: Anyone can do time arithmetic
✅ **Clear "aha" moment**: Once you see it, it's obvious
✅ **Hints guide without spoiling**: Point to the method (check times) not the answer
