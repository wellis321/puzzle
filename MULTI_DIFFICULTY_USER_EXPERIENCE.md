# Multi-Difficulty Feature: User Experience & Content Strategy

## User Experience Flow

### 1. **Landing on the Site**
- User visits the site and sees today's puzzles
- If multiple difficulties are available, they see **difficulty selector tabs** at the top:
  ```
  Choose Difficulty: [Easy] [Medium] [Hard]
  ```
- The active tab is highlighted
- Completed difficulties show a checkmark (✓)

### 2. **Selecting a Difficulty**
- User clicks on a difficulty tab (Easy, Medium, or Hard)
- The page loads that difficulty's puzzle
- They can switch between difficulties at any time using the tabs

### 3. **Solving Puzzles**
- Each difficulty is **tracked separately**
- A user can complete **all three difficulties** on the same day
- Each puzzle maintains its own:
  - Attempts (separate 3 attempts per difficulty)
  - Completion status
  - Score (Perfect/Close/Lucky)
  - Solution display

### 4. **Completion Tracking**
- When a user completes a difficulty, that tab shows a checkmark
- They can still switch to other difficulties
- Each difficulty has its own shareable result

## Content Creation Requirements

### Option 1: Full Daily Coverage (Recommended for Production)
**3 puzzles per day** = 21 puzzles per week

**Pros:**
- Maximum engagement
- Appeals to all skill levels
- Users can progress from Easy → Medium → Hard

**Cons:**
- 3x the content creation work
- More time required for puzzle design

### Option 2: Gradual Rollout (Recommended for Starting)
**Start with 1-2 difficulties, expand later**

**Week 1-2:** Only Medium puzzles (current setup)
**Week 3-4:** Add Easy puzzles (2 per day)
**Week 5+:** Add Hard puzzles (3 per day)

**Pros:**
- Easier to start
- Can test demand for different difficulties
- Allows time to build puzzle library

**Cons:**
- Users won't see selector until you have 2+ difficulties

### Option 3: Rotating Difficulties
**Only one difficulty per day, but rotate**

- Monday: Easy
- Tuesday: Medium  
- Wednesday: Hard
- Thursday: Easy
- etc.

**Pros:**
- Same content workload as before
- Still provides variety

**Cons:**
- Users can't choose difficulty
- Less engagement per day

### Option 4: Mix and Match (Flexible)
**Create puzzles as you have time**

- Some days: 1 puzzle (whatever difficulty you have ready)
- Some days: 2 puzzles (e.g., Easy + Medium)
- Some days: 3 puzzles (full set)

**Pros:**
- Most flexible
- No pressure to create 3x content
- Users see selector only when multiple exist

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent experience
- Users might be disappointed on single-puzzle days

## Recommended Strategy

### **Phase 1: Start Simple** (First Month)
- Create 1 puzzle per day (Medium difficulty)
- System works as before, no selector shown
- Build up your puzzle library

### **Phase 2: Add Difficulty** (Month 2)
- Start creating Easy versions of some puzzles
- Reuse same case, but simplify clues/statements
- When you have 2+ puzzles for a date, selector appears

### **Phase 3: Full Coverage** (Month 3+)
- Create all three difficulties for each day
- Develop a template/system for creating variants
- Consider reusing themes/cases with different difficulty levels

## Content Creation Tips

### Creating Easy Versions
- Use same case/concept
- Add more obvious clues
- Make the inconsistency more apparent
- Fewer red herrings
- Clearer language

### Creating Hard Versions  
- Use same case/concept
- Add more subtle clues
- Make inconsistency less obvious
- More red herrings
- Ambiguous language
- Require deeper analysis

### Reusing Content
You could create puzzle "families":
- **Easy**: "The Missing Watch - Easy"
- **Medium**: "The Missing Watch - Medium"  
- **Hard**: "The Missing Watch - Hard"

Same core mystery, different difficulty levels.

## User Engagement Benefits

1. **Progression Path**: Users can start Easy, work up to Hard
2. **Replayability**: More content per day = more engagement
3. **Skill Matching**: New users start Easy, experts go Hard
4. **Completion Motivation**: "Complete all three today!" achievement feel
5. **Daily Return**: More reason to come back (3x puzzles)

## Example User Journey

**Day 1:**
- User sees Easy, Medium, Hard tabs
- Completes Easy puzzle (gets checkmark ✓)
- Tries Medium puzzle (gets checkmark ✓)
- Attempts Hard puzzle (runs out of attempts)
- Returns next day for new puzzles

**Day 2:**
- User sees yesterday's Hard is still available (but solved others)
- Completes today's Easy puzzle
- Goes back to finish yesterday's Hard puzzle
- Progresses to today's Medium puzzle

This creates a **sticky daily habit** with multiple engagement points!
