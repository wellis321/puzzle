I have some ideas about a possible app that is interacted with like Wordle. 

This app would be around the theme of solving a daily crime though. Below are my ideas so far.


The appp should be

One puzzle per day

5–10 minutes max

Very simple input (tap / click / select)

Clear win or loss

Shareable result (no spoilers)

Skill-based, not trivia-based

Now let’s translate that into a crime / mystery format.

🔍 Concept Idea #1: Daily Case

Premise:
Each day, there is one mini crime.

What the player sees

Short case summary (3–4 sentences)

A small set of facts (5–8 clues)

A list of suspects / options

The goal

Answer 3–5 questions, for example:

Who did it?

What was the motive?

What was the key mistake / clue?

Mechanics

Limited guesses (like Wordle)

Each wrong guess removes or reveals a clue

Solvable only by logic (no outside knowledge)

⏱️ Playtime: 5 minutes

🧠 Reward: “Aha!” moment

🕵️ Concept Idea #2: The Missing Detail

Premise:
A crime report has one inconsistency.

Example

“The victim was found at 10:30 PM.
The suspect says they were asleep by 10.
The lights were on when police arrived…”

One detail doesn’t fit.

The goal

Find the single incorrect statement

Or identify which fact proves the crime

Mechanics

Tap/click the detail you think breaks the case

3 tries max

Hints unlock after mistakes

⏱️ Playtime: 2–5 minutes

This is very Wordle-like.

🧠 Concept Idea #3: Yes / No Detective

Premise:
The player solves the case by asking limited yes/no questions.

Mechanics

You get 5 questions

Each answer narrows the solution

Final guess at the end

Example questions:

“Did the suspect know the victim?”

“Was the crime planned?”

“Was an object moved?”

This feels deep but lightweight.

🎯 Difficulty Balance (Very Important)

To avoid “too easy” or “impossible”:

Each puzzle should be solvable in ≤ 6 logical steps

No red herrings unless clearly intentional

Every clue must matter

Test puzzles with non-gamers

A good test:

If someone explains the solution out loud and it sounds obvious afterward — you nailed it.

🧠 Feedback & Reward Loop (Wordle-Style)

After finishing:

Show step-by-step reveal

Show logic path

Give a score like:

🧠 Perfect Deduction

🔍 Close Call

😬 Lucky Guess

Then:

“Next case in 14h 22m”

Shareable emoji grid (no spoilers)
